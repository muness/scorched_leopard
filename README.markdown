Install XCode.  Apple requires auth and doesn't accept http basic auth so I can't automate that step

Execute:

	curl -L http://github.com/muness/scorched_leopard/tree/master%2Fsetup.sh?raw=true?raw=true > ./setup.sh
	curl -L http://github.com/muness/scorched_leopard/tree/master%2Fapp_installers.sh?raw=true?raw=true > ./app_installers.sh
	./setup.sh
